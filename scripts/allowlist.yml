# allowlist.yml
# This is a TEMPLATE for defining suppression rules to filter out known benign events
# from the Sigma alert report.
#
# How it works:
# Each suppression rule has a 'name', a 'description', and a list of 'conditions'.
# An event is suppressed if ALL conditions within a single suppression rule are met for that event.
# Field names used in conditions should match the column names in your final alert CSV
# (e.g., 'Initiating Process File Name', 'Process Command Line', 'Sigma Rule Title').
#
# Operators:
#   equals: Exact match (case-insensitive for strings).
#   contains: Substring match (case-insensitive).
#   startswith: Prefix match (case-insensitive).
#   endswith: Suffix match (case-insensitive).
#   in: Value is one of the items in the 'values' list (case-insensitive for strings).
#   contains_any: Event value contains any of the strings in the 'values' list.
#   startswith_any: Event value starts with any of the strings in the 'values' list.
#   endswith_any: Event value ends with any of the strings in the 'values' list.
#
# IMPORTANT: Customize this file to your environment. The examples below are illustrative.

suppressions:
  # Add your custom suppression rules below.
  # Here is a generic example of a single suppression rule:
  - name: "Generic Example: Suppress MyCompany Tool Activity"
    description: "Suppresses alerts from a known internal tool (MyCompanyTool.exe) performing routine tasks."
    conditions:
      - field: "File Name" # This should be a column name from your CSV report, e.g., the process name
        operator: "equals"
        value: "MyCompanyTool.exe"
      - field: "Process Command Line" # Another column from your CSV report
        operator: "contains"
        value: "--routine-task-argument"
      # Optional: You can make the suppression rule-specific
      # - field: "Sigma Rule Title"
      #   operator: "equals"
      #   value: "Specific Sigma Rule To Suppress For This Tool"
  #
  # You can add multiple suppression rules. Each rule is evaluated independently.
  # An event is suppressed if ALL conditions within ANY single suppression rule are met.
